This workshop has been broken down into four labs. Each Lab builds off of the previous lab, to create a complete deploy-able example. 

Each lab corresponds with the preceding presentation. You can find the slide for each presentation in the [slides folder](https://github.com/ScruffyFurn/MRWorkshop/tree/master/Slides)
